##### These are some projects i made using JavaScript

### Pizza Menu

##### For this project I made a menu where you can order a pizza with various toppings. It then takes the information given and calculates the price.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

##### For this project I created a standard game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It randomizes which player goes first, then users can click the square they want to play. After a line of 3 has been made a winner is declared and the board is reset, and if there is a tie it is also reset.

### Calculator

##### A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
